#V1-behavior-neurons

This repo contains code for analysing behavioral and neural data. The two primary components are the [behavenet](https://github.com/ebatty/behavenet) package for explicit and latent behavioral analysis, and the notebooks folder, which contains jupyter notebooks to visualize the results.
